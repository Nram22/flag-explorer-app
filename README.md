## Overview

The Flag Explorer App is a coding challenge project that:
- Implements a REST API using ASP.NET Core 8.
- Exposes endpoints for retrieving a list of countries and country details.
- Uses an external Open API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to fetch country data.
- Provides a React frontend that displays the country flags in a grid (Home Screen) and shows detailed country information when a flag is clicked.
- Includes automated tests for both backend and frontend.
- Has CI/CD pipeline configurations (YAML files) for continuous integration and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have installed:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js (v18 or later)](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git

## Backend Setup

### Installation & Running (Backend)

1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies, build, and run the API:**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   dotnet run
   ```

   The API will be available at: [http://localhost:5083](http://localhost:5083)

3. **CORS Configuration:**  
   The backend is configured (in `Program.cs`) to allow requests from the frontend running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing (Backend)

Run the tests using:

```bash
dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal backend/Tests
```

Backend tests (e.g., `CountriesControllerTests.cs`) use Moq and xUnit to validate API endpoints.

## Frontend Setup

### Installation & Running (Frontend)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs required packages including:
   - `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`
   - `bootstrap`
   - `web-vitals`
   - Development dependencies: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jest-junit`

3. **Run the React App:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing (Frontend)

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

- **Test Files:**  
  - `App.test.js` verifies the loading indicator is rendered.
  - `Home.test.js` checks the Home page.
  - `Detail.test.js` mocks fetch requests and verifies country details are displayed correctly.

- **Jest JUnit Reporting:**  
  A `.env` file in the frontend root contains:
  ```
  JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT=./test-results/junit.xml
  ```

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### Backend CI/CD

File: **.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml**

```yaml
name: Backend CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore backend
      - name: Build
        run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release backend
      - name: Run tests

        with:
          name: backend-test-results
          path: backend/Tests/test_results.trx
      - name: Publish
        run: dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish backend
```

### Frontend CI/CD

File: **.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml**

```yaml

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

          name: frontend-test-results
          path: frontend/test-results/junit.xml
      - name: Build the application
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: frontend
```

## 6. Additional Files & Recommendations

1. **.gitignore:**  
   A single `.gitignore` at the root should cover both backend and frontend files:

   ```gitignore
   # .NET Core
   **/bin/
   **/obj/
   **/publish/

   # Node / React
   frontend/node_modules/
   frontend/build/

   # Environment files
   .env
   ```

2. **README.md:**  
   This document serves as the startup guide.

3. **Assets:**  
   If your React app references a placeholder image (e.g., `/placeholder.png`), place it in `frontend/public/`.

4. **Documentation:**  
Below is an updated README section that includes additional documentation such as API endpoint details and an architecture overview. You can add this to your README.md file under the "Documentation" section or as a new section.

### Documentation

#### API Endpoint Details

The backend API is built with ASP.NET Core 8 and exposes the following endpoints:

1. **GET /api/countries**  
   - **Description:** Retrieves a list of all countries with summary details.
   - **Response Format:**  
     ```json
     [
       {
         "name": "France",
         "flag": "https://flagcdn.com/fr.png"
       },
       {
         "name": "Germany",
         "flag": "https://flagcdn.com/de.png"
       },
       // ...more countries
     ]
     ```

2. **GET /api/countries/{name}**  
   - **Description:** Retrieves detailed information for a specific country identified by its name.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `name` (path, required): The country name.
   - **Response Format:**  
     ```json
     {
       "name": "France",
       "capital": "Paris",
       "population": 67000000,
       "flag": "https://flagcdn.com/fr.png"
     }
     ```
   - **Error Responses:**
     - **400 Bad Request:** When the country name is missing or empty.
     - **404 Not Found:** When no country matching the given name is found.

*These endpoints are documented using Swagger, which is accessible during development at [http://localhost:5083/swagger](http://localhost:5083/swagger).*

#### Architecture Overview

**Backend:**
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core 8  
- **Architecture Pattern:** Follows modern practices with separation of concerns:
  - **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Models:** Define data structures for country summaries (`Country`) and details (`CountryDetails`).
  - **Services:** Contain business logic for retrieving and caching country data from an external API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).  
  - **Interface (ICountryService):** Defines contract for the country service, making it easier to implement unit tests using dependency injection and mocking.
- **Testing:**  
  Unit and integration tests (using xUnit and Moq) verify that API endpoints work as expected.
- **Configuration:**  
  CORS is configured to allow requests from the React frontend ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). Swagger is used for API documentation.

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React (created with Create React App)  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Home Screen:** Displays a grid of country flags. It uses the CountryContext to fetch and provide data from the backend.
  - **Detail Screen:** When a flag is clicked, detailed information about the country (name, capital, population, flag) is displayed.
- **Routing:**  
  React Router is used to manage navigation between the Home and Detail screens.
- **Styling:**  
  Bootstrap is utilized for responsive grid layouts and basic styling.
- **Testing:**  
  Automated tests are written using React Testing Library and Jest to verify component behavior and UI rendering.
- **Environment & Configuration:**  
  The frontend includes a `.env` file for configuring Jest reporters (if needed), and package dependencies are managed via `package.json`.

#### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

The solution includes YAML configuration files to set up CI/CD pipelines on GitHub:

- **Backend CI/CD:**  
  Runs on pushes/pull requests to build the ASP.NET Core API, run tests, and package the application. It uses a test logger to generate test result artifacts.
- **Frontend CI/CD:**  
  Installs Node.js dependencies, runs React tests, and builds the frontend. Test results can be uploaded as artifacts if configured with jest-junit.

*Both pipelines ensure that automated tests are run before deployment, and the builds are packaged for potential deployment to services such as Azure or similar hosting platforms.*

    ```
  - **Frontend:**  
    ```bash
    npm start
    npm test -- --watchAll=false
    ```
